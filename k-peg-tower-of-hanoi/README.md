# K-Peg Tower of Hanoi Solver (C++)

This project implements a generalized solution to the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using **K pegs**. It extends the traditional 3-peg recursive approach to support any number of pegs and disks.

## üìÑ Files
- `K_Hanoi.cpp` ‚Äì Main driver that prompts for user input and calls the solver
- `K_Hanoi.h` ‚Äì Header file that defines the recursive logic inside the `Towers` class

## üí° Concepts Demonstrated
- Recursive problem-solving
- Divide-and-conquer strategy
- Minimal move optimization for K > 3 pegs
- Algorithm design and modular C++

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Compile:
```bash
g++ K_Hanoi.cpp -o hanoi
