# Coin Toss Game â€“ Simulation & Optimization (C++)

This project explores a probability-based coin toss game between two playersâ€”Alice and Bob. Alice wins if she gets more heads than Bob. The goal is to determine the optimal number of tosses that maximizes Alice's chance of winning.

## ðŸ§© Components

### ðŸ”¹ part1.cpp
- Calculates the **optimal number of tosses** analytically
- Uses combinatorics to compute probabilities of different outcomes

### ðŸ”¹ part2.cpp
- **Simulates** thousands of games for varying toss counts
- Compares **empirical win rates** to theoretical values
- Outputs results as a CSV for visualization
